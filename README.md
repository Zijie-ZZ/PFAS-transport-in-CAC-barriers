# PFAS transport in CAC-amended groundwater barriers

This repository contains MATLAB codes used to simulate PFAS transport in
colloidal activated carbon (CAC)–amended sand columns, with a focus on
particle-scale mass-transfer limitations and non-equilibrium sorption.

The model solves a one-dimensional advection–dispersion equation with
nonlinear Freundlich sorption and a two-site formulation that accounts for
both equilibrium and kinetic sorption domains. The codes provided here
support the analyses and figures presented in the associated manuscript.

## 4-line Summary

The codes simulate PFAS transport in colloidal activated carbon (CAC)–amended
sand columns using a one-dimensional advection–dispersion model with nonlinear
Freundlich sorption and two-site (equilibrium + kinetic) mass transfer.
The model reproduces non-ideal breakthrough behavior observed in column
experiments and supports the analyses presented in the associated manuscript.
